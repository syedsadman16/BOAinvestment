**Inspiration**
A chat-bot that would guide beginners or experts find investment learning resources that are aimed towards their experience level. Catered towards beginners educational resources such as videos and lessons would provide a smooth start.
There are some questions which resources may not answer directly and in those times itâ€™s best to speak directly with someone who knows about investing. Users will also have the ability to chat, speak, or even video call one-on-one with a investment representative, and make an appointment at a local branch via the chatbot.
